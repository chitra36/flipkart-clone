# flipkart-clone

I developed a Flipkart clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involved creating a replica of the Flipkart website's navigation bar, products page, and footer.

In the navigation bar,
I implemented a responsive design with a logo, menu items, and user action links such as login and signup. The menu items were styled to match the Flipkart style guide.

For the products page,
I designed a grid layout to display trending products. Each product card featured an image, title, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. The product cards were dynamically generated using JavaScript for a seamless user experience.

In addition,
I implemented a banner section with an eye-catching image or slideshow to draw attention to featured products. The footer included copyright information and maintained the same design theme as the rest of the project.

Overall,the Flipkart clone project demonstrated my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my ability to replicate a complex e-commerce website's key features and design elements.
